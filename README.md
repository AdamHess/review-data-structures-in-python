Part of learning a new language involves trying to do the same task as you would in any other to hone your craft. These are called "Katas" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming) 

the most common tasks asked during interviews are linkedlist or binary tree based with that in mind data structure implementation is my Kata of choice to keep those skills sharper than usual. 


Each file represents a different data structure type and has a little tester for showing it off in action. 

After synching it down run the tester.py file to get all the testers up and running.
